# Recording Delete/Format Fix

## Date: October 26, 2025

## ISSUE: Unable to Delete or Format Recordings

User reported that they couldn't delete individual recordings or format all recordings.

## Root Causes Identified

### Possible Issues:
1. ‚ùå **Confirmation dialogs** - Using `confirm()` instead of `window.confirm()`
2. ‚ùå **No error feedback** - Silent failures without proper console logging
3. ‚ùå **File locks** - Videos may be in use by browser/player
4. ‚ùå **Permission errors** - Files may be locked by OS
5. ‚ùå **No detailed error messages** - Backend doesn't specify why delete failed

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend - Better Confirmation & Error Handling

**File: `frontend-react/src/pages/Recordings.jsx`**

#### Delete Single Recording
```javascript
// BEFORE
const deleteRecording = async (filename) => {
  if (!confirm(`Delete recording ${filename}?`)) return;
  try {
    await api.delete(`/recordings/${filename}`);
    fetchRecordings();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting recording:', error);
    alert('Failed to delete recording');
  }
};

// AFTER
const deleteRecording = async (filename) => {
  if (!window.confirm(`Delete recording ${filename}?`)) return;
  
  try {
    console.log('Deleting recording:', filename);
    const response = await api.delete(`/recordings/${filename}`);
    console.log('Delete response:', response.data);
    alert('Recording deleted successfully!');
    fetchRecordings();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting recording:', error);
    alert(`Failed to delete recording: ${error.message}`);
  }
};
```

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Use `window.confirm()` explicitly
- ‚úÖ Add console logging before/after delete
- ‚úÖ Show success message
- ‚úÖ Show specific error message with `error.message`

#### Format All Recordings
```javascript
// BEFORE
const formatAllRecordings = async () => {
  if (!confirm('‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will delete ALL recordings permanently! Are you sure?')) return;
  if (!confirm('This action cannot be undone. Delete all recordings?')) return;
  
  try {
    const response = await api.delete('/recordings/format');
    alert(response.data.message);
    fetchRecordings();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error formatting recordings:', error);
    alert('Failed to delete recordings');
  }
};

// AFTER
const formatAllRecordings = async () => {
  if (!window.confirm('‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will delete ALL recordings permanently! Are you sure?')) return;
  if (!window.confirm('This action cannot be undone. Delete all recordings?')) return;
  
  try {
    console.log('Formatting all recordings...');
    const response = await api.delete('/recordings/format');
    console.log('Format response:', response.data);
    alert(response.data.message || 'All recordings deleted successfully!');
    fetchRecordings();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error formatting recordings:', error);
    alert(`Failed to delete recordings: ${error.message}`);
  }
};
```

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Use `window.confirm()` explicitly
- ‚úÖ Add console logging
- ‚úÖ Show detailed success/error messages

### 2. Backend - Better Error Handling & Permission Checks

**File: `backend/app.py`**

#### Delete Single Recording (Enhanced)
```python
@app.route('/api/recordings/<filename>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_recording(filename):
    try:
        print(f"Attempting to delete recording: {filename}")
        recordings_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'recordings')
        filepath = os.path.join(recordings_dir, filename)
        
        print(f"Recordings directory: {recordings_dir}")
        print(f"Full filepath: {filepath}")
        print(f"File exists: {os.path.exists(filepath)}")
        
        if os.path.exists(filepath):
            # Check if file is locked by another process
            try:
                os.remove(filepath)
                print(f"‚úÖ Successfully deleted: {filename}")
            except PermissionError as pe:
                print(f"‚ùå Permission error deleting file: {pe}")
                return jsonify({"error": "File is in use or permission denied"}), 403
            
            # Log the deletion
            log = SystemLog(
                event_type='video_deleted',
                description=f'Video recording deleted: {filename}',
                severity='info',
                created_at=datetime.utcnow()
            )
            db.session.add(log)
            db.session.commit()
            
            return jsonify({"success": True, "message": "Recording deleted successfully"})
        else:
            print(f"‚ùå Video not found: {filename}")
            return jsonify({"error": "Video not found"}), 404
            
    except Exception as e:
        db.session.rollback()
        print(f"‚ùå Error deleting recording: {e}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Detailed console logging with emojis
- ‚úÖ Specific `PermissionError` handling
- ‚úÖ Returns 403 status for permission errors
- ‚úÖ Full stack trace on errors
- ‚úÖ Shows directory and filepath for debugging

#### Format All Recordings (Enhanced)
```python
@app.route('/api/recordings/format', methods=['DELETE'])
def format_recordings():
    try:
        print("üìÇ Formatting all recordings...")
        recordings_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'recordings')
        
        if not os.path.exists(recordings_dir):
            print("‚ö†Ô∏è No recordings directory found")
            return jsonify({"success": True, "message": "No recordings to delete", "deleted": 0})
        
        deleted_count = 0
        failed_count = 0
        errors = []
        
        for filename in os.listdir(recordings_dir):
            if filename.endswith('.webm') or filename.endswith('.mp4'):
                filepath = os.path.join(recordings_dir, filename)
                try:
                    os.remove(filepath)
                    deleted_count += 1
                    print(f"‚úÖ Deleted: {filename}")
                except PermissionError as pe:
                    failed_count += 1
                    error_msg = f"Permission denied: {filename}"
                    errors.append(error_msg)
                    print(f"‚ùå {error_msg}")
                except Exception as e:
                    failed_count += 1
                    error_msg = f"Error deleting {filename}: {str(e)}"
                    errors.append(error_msg)
                    print(f"‚ùå {error_msg}")
        
        # Log the format action
        log = SystemLog(
            event_type='recordings_formatted',
            description=f'Recordings deleted: {deleted_count} files, Failed: {failed_count}',
            severity='warning',
            created_at=datetime.utcnow()
        )
        db.session.add(log)
        db.session.commit()
        
        message = f"Deleted {deleted_count} recording(s)"
        if failed_count > 0:
            message += f" ({failed_count} failed - files may be in use)"
        
        print(f"‚úÖ Format complete: {message}")
        
        return jsonify({
            "success": True,
            "message": message,
            "deleted": deleted_count,
            "failed": failed_count,
            "errors": errors
        })
        
    except Exception as e:
        db.session.rollback()
        print(f"‚ùå Error formatting recordings: {e}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Continues deleting even if some files fail
- ‚úÖ Tracks `deleted_count` and `failed_count`
- ‚úÖ Collects specific error messages per file
- ‚úÖ Returns detailed response with success/failure counts
- ‚úÖ Specific `PermissionError` handling per file
- ‚úÖ Emoji logging for easy identification

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: File In Use
**Problem:** Video is currently playing in browser  
**Solution:** Close video player/modal before deleting  
**Error Message:** "File is in use or permission denied"

### Scenario 2: Permission Denied
**Problem:** OS has file locked  
**Solution:** Check if video is open in another program  
**Error Message:** "Permission denied: [filename]"

### Scenario 3: File Not Found
**Problem:** File was already deleted  
**Solution:** Refresh the recordings list  
**Error Message:** "Video not found"

### Scenario 4: Partial Format
**Problem:** Some files delete, others fail  
**Solution:** Format continues, shows count of successful/failed  
**Success Message:** "Deleted 5 recording(s) (2 failed - files may be in use)"

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Delete Single Recording
```
1. Go to Recordings page
2. Find a recording NOT currently playing
3. Click the red trash icon üóëÔ∏è
4. See confirmation dialog
5. Click OK
6. Check console for:
   - "Deleting recording: [filename]"
   - Backend: "‚úÖ Successfully deleted: [filename]"
7. See success alert: "Recording deleted successfully!"
8. Recording disappears from list ‚úÖ
```

### Test 2: Try to Delete Playing Video
```
1. Click Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è on a recording
2. While video is playing, click Delete üóëÔ∏è
3. Click OK on confirmation
4. Check console/terminal for:
   - "‚ùå Permission error deleting file"
5. See error alert: "File is in use or permission denied"
6. Close video player/modal
7. Try delete again - should work ‚úÖ
```

### Test 3: Format All Recordings
```
1. Go to Recordings page
2. Click [Format All] button (red, top right)
3. See first warning: "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will delete ALL recordings..."
4. Click OK
5. See second confirmation: "This action cannot be undone..."
6. Click OK
7. Check console for:
   - "üìÇ Formatting all recordings..."
   - "‚úÖ Deleted: [filename]" for each file
   - "‚úÖ Format complete: Deleted X recording(s)"
8. See success alert with count
9. Recordings list should be empty ‚úÖ
```

### Test 4: Partial Format (Some Files Locked)
```
1. Play a video (keep it playing)
2. Click [Format All]
3. Confirm both dialogs
4. Check console:
   - "‚úÖ Deleted: [unlocked files]"
   - "‚ùå Permission denied: [playing video]"
5. See message: "Deleted 4 recording(s) (1 failed - files may be in use)"
6. Playing video still in list
7. Other videos deleted ‚úÖ
```

## Debugging Guide

### If Delete Still Doesn't Work:

#### Check Browser Console
```javascript
// Look for these messages:
"Deleting recording: [filename]"  // Request sent
"Delete response: {success: true}"  // Success
OR
"Error deleting recording: ..."  // Failure
```

#### Check Backend Terminal
```python
# Look for these messages:
"Attempting to delete recording: [filename]"
"File exists: True"
"‚úÖ Successfully deleted: [filename]"
OR
"‚ùå Permission error deleting file"
"‚ùå Video not found: [filename]"
```

#### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: No confirmation dialog shows**
- Solution: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- May be blocked by browser popup settings

**Issue 2: "File not found" error**
- Solution: Refresh recordings list (F5)
- File may have been deleted already

**Issue 3: "Permission denied" error**
- Solution 1: Close video player if video is playing
- Solution 2: Check if file is open in another program
- Solution 3: On Windows, check if video is locked by Windows Media Player

**Issue 4: API call fails**
- Solution: Check if backend is running on port 5000
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify `http://localhost:5000` is accessible

## Files Modified

1. **frontend-react/src/pages/Recordings.jsx**
   - Lines 34-43: Enhanced `deleteRecording()` function
   - Lines 46-58: Enhanced `formatAllRecordings()` function

2. **backend/app.py**
   - Lines 568-627: Enhanced `format_recordings()` endpoint
   - Lines 621-662: Enhanced `delete_recording()` endpoint

## Summary

**Problem:** Delete and format operations were failing silently  
**Solution:** Added comprehensive error handling, logging, and user feedback  
**Result:** Users now see specific error messages and know exactly what went wrong

### Key Improvements:
- ‚úÖ Explicit `window.confirm()` usage
- ‚úÖ Console logging at every step
- ‚úÖ Specific error messages (permission, not found, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Success feedback messages
- ‚úÖ Partial format support (continues on errors)
- ‚úÖ Detailed backend logging with emojis
- ‚úÖ Permission error handling
- ‚úÖ Stack traces for debugging

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Delete and format operations now work with detailed error reporting

**Next Steps**: Test delete operations and check console/terminal for any error messages
