### ‚ùå Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Button doesn't respond**
   - Check console for errors
   - Verify backend is running (http://localhost:5000)

2. **Status doesn't update**
   - Check Network tab for failed PUT request to `/api/cameras/laptop/status`
   - Verify camera exists in database

3. **Recording doesn't actually stop/start**
   - Check console logs for service errors
   - Verify camera permissions are granted

4. **Timer doesn't reset**
   - This is normal - timer should reset when starting new recording
