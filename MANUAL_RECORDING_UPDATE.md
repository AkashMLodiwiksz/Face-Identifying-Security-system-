# 🎬 Recording System Update - Manual Control

## Changes Made (October 19, 2025)

### Summary
Changed the recording system to **manual control only** - recording no longer starts automatically, and stops when the user clicks the stop button.

---

## ✅ What Was Changed

### 1. **Removed Auto-Start on Login**
**File:** `/frontend-react/src/pages/Login.jsx`
- ❌ Removed: `backgroundRecordingService.start()` call after login
- ✅ Now: System logs in without starting any recording

### 2. **Removed Auto-Start on Camera Activation**
**File:** `/frontend-react/src/components/WebcamCapture.jsx`
- ❌ Removed: Automatic recording start when camera starts
- ✅ Now: Camera starts, but recording only starts when user clicks button

### 3. **Removed Auto-Restart After 5 Minutes**
**File:** `/frontend-react/src/components/WebcamCapture.jsx`
- ❌ Removed: Auto-restart logic after 5-minute segments
- ❌ Removed: Auto-stop at 5 minutes
- ✅ Now: Recording continues until user manually stops it

### 4. **Stop Recording Saves Video**
**File:** `/frontend-react/src/components/WebcamCapture.jsx`
- ✅ When stop button clicked → Recording stops → Video uploads → Done
- ✅ No automatic restart

### 5. **Fixed Format All Button**
**File:** `/backend/app.py`
- ❌ Issue: Route `/api/recordings/format` was being matched by `/api/recordings/<filename>`
- ✅ Fix: Moved `/format` route BEFORE `/<filename>` route
- ✅ Removed duplicate format route

## 📹 Video Saving

### When Recording Stops
```
1. User clicks "Stop Camera & Recording"
   ↓
2. MediaRecorder stops
   ↓
3. Video blob created from chunks
   ↓
4. Upload to backend: POST /api/recordings/upload
   ↓
5. File saved: /backend/recordings/recording_<timestamp>.webm
   ↓
6. Done - ready for next recording
```

### File Naming
- Format: `recording_<timestamp>.webm`
- Example: `recording_1729344000123.webm`
- Location: `/backend/recordings/`

---

## 🗑️ Format All Button

### How It Works Now
```
1. Click "Format All" button
   ↓
2. Confirmation 1: "⚠️ WARNING: This will delete ALL recordings permanently! Are you sure?"
   ↓
3. Confirmation 2: "This action cannot be undone. Delete all recordings?"
   ↓
4. Backend: DELETE /api/recordings/format
   ↓
5. All .webm and .mp4 files deleted
   ↓
6. System log entry created
   ↓
7. Success message shown
   ↓
8. Page refreshes with updated list
```

### Why It's Fixed
- **Problem:** Flask was matching `/format` as `<filename>`
- **Solution:** Moved `/format` route before `/<filename>` route
- **Result:** `/format` route now accessible ✅
