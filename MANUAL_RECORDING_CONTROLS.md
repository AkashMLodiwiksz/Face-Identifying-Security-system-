# Manual Recording Controls Update

## Date: October 26, 2025

## Overview
Added manual Start/Stop recording controls to the Dashboard while maintaining automatic recording functionality. Users can now manually control recording sessions, and the system updates camera status accordingly.

## 🎯 New Features

### 1. **Start/Stop Recording Buttons**
- **Location**: Dashboard page (top banner)
- **Start Button**: Green button with play icon
  - Appears when recording is stopped
  - Resumes recording session
  - Updates camera status to "online"
- **Stop Button**: White button with stop icon
  - Appears when recording is active
  - Stops current recording and saves segment
  - Updates camera status to "offline"

### 2. **Dynamic Recording Status Banner**
- **Recording Active** (Red background):
  - Shows pulsing dot animation
  - Displays "Background Recording Active"
  - Shows recording time counter
  - Displays Stop button
  
- **Recording Stopped** (Gray background):
  - Shows "Recording Stopped"
  - No timer display
  - Displays Start button

### 3. **Camera Status Synchronization**
- Camera status in backend updates automatically:
  - **Recording Active** → Camera status: "online"
  - **Recording Stopped** → Camera status: "offline"
- Status visible in Cameras page and live monitoring

## 📝 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **Dashboard.jsx** (`/frontend-react/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)
```jsx
// Added new icons import
import { Square, Play } from 'lucide-react';

// New handler functions
const handleStartRecording = async () => {
  await backgroundRecordingService.resumeRecording();
};

const handleStopRecording = async () => {
  await backgroundRecordingService.pauseRecording();
};

// Updated status banner with conditional rendering
<div className={`${recordingStatus.isRecording ? 'bg-red-500' : 'bg-gray-600'} ...`}>
  {/* Dynamic content based on recording state */}
  {recordingStatus.isRecording ? (
    <button onClick={handleStopRecording}>Stop Recording</button>
  ) : (
    <button onClick={handleStartRecording}>Start Recording</button>
  )}
</div>
```

#### 2. **backgroundRecording.js** (`/frontend-react/src/services/backgroundRecording.js`)

**New Methods:**

```javascript
// Pause recording (saves current segment)
async pauseRecording() {
  - Stops current recording segment
  - Saves video file
  - Clears recording timer
  - Updates camera status to 'offline'
  - Sets isRecording = false
}

// Resume recording (starts new segment)
async resumeRecording() {
  - Checks if service is initialized
  - Updates camera status to 'online'
  - Starts new recording session
  - Resets recording timer
  - Sets isRecording = true
}

// Update camera status in backend
async updateCameraStatus(status) {
  - PUT request to /api/cameras/laptop/status
  - Updates camera status ('online' or 'offline')
}
```

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **app.py** (`/backend/app.py`)

**New Endpoint:**

```python
@app.route('/api/cameras/laptop/status', methods=['PUT'])
def update_laptop_camera_status():
    """
    Update laptop camera status
    
    Request Body:
    {
        "status": "online" | "offline"
    }
    
    Response:
    {
        "success": true,
        "message": "Camera status updated to {status}",
        "cameraId": 1,
        "status": "online"
    }
    """
    - Finds Laptop Camera in database
    - Updates status field
    - Updates is_active field (true for online, false for offline)
    - Returns success response
```

## 🎬 How It Works

### Recording Flow

1. **Auto-Start (Existing)**:
   - User logs in → Recording starts automatically
   - User goes to Dashboard → Recording initializes if not started

2. **Manual Stop (New)**:
   - User clicks "Stop Recording" button
   - Current segment stops and saves to backend
   - Camera status updates to "offline"
   - Banner turns gray, shows "Recording Stopped"
   - Start button appears

3. **Manual Start (New)**:
   - User clicks "Start Recording" button
   - New recording session begins
   - Camera status updates to "online"
   - Banner turns red, shows "Background Recording Active"
   - Timer starts counting
   - Stop button appears

### Video Saving

- **All recordings save the same way**:
  - 2-minute segments
  - Automatic upload to backend
  - Stored in `/backend/recordings/` directory
  - Timestamped filenames: `recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.webm`
  - Visible in Recordings page
  - Continuous playback supported
