# üîç Camera Not Recording - Debugging Guide

## Step 1: Check Browser Console

After logging in, open the browser console (Press **F12**) and look for these messages:

### ‚úÖ Expected Messages (What You Should See):
```
üìç Attempting to start background recording...
üìç BackgroundRecordingService.start() called
üìç Current state - isInitialized: false
üé¨ Starting background recording service...
üìç Requesting camera access...
‚úÖ Camera access granted for background recording
üìç Camera stream: [MediaStream object]
‚úÖ Camera registered with backend
üìç Starting recording in 1 second...
‚úÖ Background recording service initialized
‚úÖ Background recording service started after login
üìç startRecording() called
üìç Current state - stream: true isRecording: false
üìç Setting up MediaRecorder...
üìç Using codec: video/webm;codecs=vp9
üî¥ Background recording started - continuous recording (2-minute segments)
```

### ‚ùå If You See Permission Error:
```
‚ùå Failed to start background recording: NotAllowedError
‚ùå Error name: NotAllowedError
‚ùå Error message: Permission denied
```

**Solution:** Allow camera access in browser
- Click the camera icon in address bar
- Click "Allow" for camera permission
- Refresh page and login again

### ‚ùå If You See "Camera Already in Use":
```
‚ùå Failed to start background recording: NotReadableError
‚ùå Error name: NotReadableError
‚ùå Error message: Could not start video source
```

**Solution:** Close other apps using camera
- Close Zoom, Teams, Skype, etc.
- Close other browser tabs using camera
- Restart browser and try again

## Step 2: Test Camera Manually

Open console (F12) and run:
```javascript
// Test 1: Check if backgroundRecordingService exists
backgroundRecordingService

// Test 2: Check current status
backgroundRecordingService.getStatus()

// Test 3: Try to start manually
await backgroundRecordingService.start()
```

## Step 3: Check Dashboard

1. Go to Dashboard page
2. Look for red banner at top
3. Should say: "Background Recording Active"
4. Should show timer counting up

**If NOT showing:**
- Recording didn't start
- Check console for errors

---

## Step 4: Check Camera Permission

### Chrome:
1. Click üîí lock icon in address bar
2. Look for "Camera" setting
3. Should be "Allow"
4. If blocked, change to "Allow" and refresh

### Firefox:
1. Click üîí lock icon in address bar
2. Click "Connection secure" > "More information"
3. Go to "Permissions" tab
4. Find "Use the Camera"
5. Remove "Block" if present

### Edge:
1. Click üîí lock icon in address bar
2. Click "Permissions for this site"
3. Find "Camera"
4. Set to "Allow"

## Step 5: Manual Camera Test

Try this simple test in console:
```javascript
// Test if camera works at all
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })
  .then(stream => {
    console.log('‚úÖ Camera works!', stream);
    stream.getTracks().forEach(t => t.stop());
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('‚ùå Camera error:', err);
  });
```
