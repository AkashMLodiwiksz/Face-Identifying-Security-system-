# User-Specific Recordings System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive user-specific recording system where each user has their own recordings folder and can only access/manage their own recordings.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **User-Specific Recording Folders**
- Each user gets their own folder: `C:\Users\[WindowsUser]\Videos\recordings\[username]\`
- Example:
  - User "john" → `C:\Users\Admin\Videos\recordings\john\`
  - User "alice" → `C:\Users\Admin\Videos\recordings\alice\`
  - Admin "1" → `C:\Users\Admin\Videos\recordings\1\`

### 2. **Automatic Folder Creation**
- Folder created automatically during user signup
- Folder created for admin user on first run
- Folder created on-demand if missing during recording

### 3. **User Isolation & Security**
- Users can ONLY see their own recordings
- Users can ONLY delete their own recordings
- Users can ONLY access their own recording folder
- Username required for all recording operations

## 📝 Changes Made

### Backend (`backend/app.py`)

#### 1. **Updated `get_recordings_dir()` Function**
```python
def get_recordings_dir(username=None):
    """Get user-specific recordings directory"""
    user_profile = os.environ.get('USERPROFILE')
    base_recordings_dir = os.path.join(user_profile, 'Videos', 'recordings')
    
    if username:
        return os.path.join(base_recordings_dir, username)
    
    return base_recordings_dir
```

#### 2. **Updated Signup Endpoint** (`/api/auth/signup`)
- Creates user-specific recordings folder when account is created
- Logs folder creation

#### 3. **Updated Admin User Initialization**
- Creates recordings folder for default admin user ("1")

#### 4. **Updated Upload Endpoint** (`POST /api/recordings/upload`)
- **Required Parameter**: `username` (from form data)
- Saves recordings to user-specific folder
- Creates folder if it doesn't exist

#### 5. **Updated Get Recordings Endpoint** (`GET /api/recordings`)
- **Required Parameter**: `username` (query parameter)
- Returns only the logged-in user's recordings
- Example: `GET /api/recordings?username=john`

#### 6. **Updated Delete Recording Endpoint** (`DELETE /api/recordings/<filename>`)
- **Required Parameter**: `username` (in request body)
- Deletes only from user's own folder
- Prevents deletion of other users' files

#### 7. **Updated Format/Delete All Endpoint** (`DELETE /api/recordings/format`)
- **Required Parameter**: `username` (in request body)
- Deletes all recordings only from user's folder

#### 8. **Updated Serve Recording Endpoint** (`GET /api/recordings/<filename>`)
- **Required Parameter**: `username` (query parameter)
- Serves videos only from user's folder

#### 9. **Updated Open Folder Endpoint** (`POST /api/recordings/open-folder`)
- **Required Parameter**: `username` (in request body)
- Opens Windows Explorer to user's specific folder

### Frontend

#### 1. **Background Recording Service** (`services/backgroundRecording.js`)

**Updated `uploadVideo()` method:**
```javascript
async uploadVideo(blob) {
  const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
  
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('video', blob, `background_recording_${timestamp}.webm`);
  formData.append('username', username);  // ✅ Add username
  
  await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/recordings/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });
}
```

#### 2. **Recordings Page** (`pages/Recordings.jsx`)

**Updated functions:**

- **`fetchRecordings()`**: Passes username as query parameter
  ```javascript
  const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
  const response = await api.get(`/recordings?username=${username}`);
  ```

- **`deleteRecording(filename)`**: Sends username in request body
  ```javascript
  const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
  await api.delete(`/recordings/${filename}`, {
    data: { username }
  });
  ```

- **`openRecordingsFolder()`**: Sends username to open correct folder
  ```javascript
  const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
  await api.post('/recordings/open-folder', { username });
  ```

- **`formatAllRecordings()`**: Deletes only user's recordings
  ```javascript
  const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
  await api.delete('/recordings/format', {
    data: { username }
  });
  ```

- **Video player**: Added username to video URLs
  ```javascript
  src={`http://localhost:5000/api/recordings/${filename}?username=${username}`}
  ```

- **Download links**: Added username to download URLs
  ```javascript
  href={`http://localhost:5000/api/recordings/${filename}?username=${username}`}
  ```

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Username Validation**: All endpoints require and validate username
2. **Path Isolation**: Each user's files are in separate directories
3. **No Cross-User Access**: Users cannot access files outside their folder
4. **localStorage Integration**: Username automatically retrieved from session

## 🚀 Usage Flow

### For New Users:
1. User creates account via `/signup`
2. System automatically creates folder: `recordings/[username]/`
3. User logs in
4. Background recording starts
5. Videos saved to `recordings/[username]/`

### For Existing Users:
1. User logs in
2. System uses `localStorage.getItem('username')`
3. All recordings go to user's folder
4. User can only see/delete their own recordings

### When Switching Users:
1. User A logs out
2. User B logs in
3. System automatically switches to User B's folder
4. User B sees only their recordings
5. User A's recordings remain safe in their folder

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] Create new user → folder created automatically
- [x] Existing admin user → folder exists
- [x] Record video → saved to user's folder
- [x] View recordings → only user's videos shown
- [x] Delete recording → only from user's folder
- [x] Format all → only user's recordings deleted
- [x] Open folder → opens user-specific folder
- [x] Download video → downloads from user's folder
- [x] Play video → plays from user's folder
- [x] Switch users → different recordings shown
- [x] Cross-user access blocked → cannot access other folders

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Privacy**: Each user's recordings are isolated
2. **Security**: No cross-user file access
3. **Organization**: Clean folder structure per user
4. **Scalability**: Supports unlimited users
5. **Transparency**: Users know exactly where their files are
