# üé• Automatic Video Recording System - Updated

## Overview
The recording system now starts automatically when you start the camera and continues until you stop the camera. No manual recording buttons needed!

## ‚úÖ New Behavior

### Automatic Recording
- **Start Camera** ‚Üí Recording starts automatically within 0.5 seconds
- **Stop Camera** ‚Üí Recording stops and camera released
- **Change Tabs** ‚Üí Recording continues in background (no interruption)
- **5-Minute Segments** ‚Üí Auto-saves and starts new recording
- **Continuous** ‚Üí Records until you stop the camera

### Button Changes
**Before:**
- Start Camera
- Start Recording (separate button)
- Stop Recording (separate button)
- Stop Camera

**Now:**
- **"Start Camera & Recording"** - Does both at once
- **"Stop Camera & Recording"** - Stops both at once
- **"Capture"** - Take snapshots (still available)

```

### 2. Continuous Recording
```

Process repeats until you stop
```

```

## üîß Technical Changes

### Auto-Start Recording
```javascript
// In startCamera() function
videoRef.current.play()
  .then(() => {
    setIsStreaming(true);
    
    // AUTO-START RECORDING
    setTimeout(() => {
      startRecording();
    }, 500);
  });
```

### Auto-Stop Recording
```javascript
// In stopCamera() function
const stopCamera = () => {
  // Stop recording first
  if (isRecording) {
    stopRecording();
  }
  
  // Then stop camera
  stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
  setIsStreaming(false);
};
```

### Handle Tab Switching
```javascript
// Visibility change handler
useEffect(() => {
  const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
    if (document.hidden) {
      console.log('Tab hidden - recording continues');
    } else {
      console.log('Tab visible - recording still active');
    }
  };

  document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
}, []);
```

### Auto-Restart After 5 Minutes
```javascript
mediaRecorderRef.current.onstop = async () => {
  // Upload video
  await uploadVideo(blob);
  
  // Auto-restart if camera still on
  if (isStreaming && stream) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setRecordingTime(0);
      startRecording(); // Start next segment
    }, 1000);
  }
};
```

### Timeslice for Reliability
```javascript
// Start with 1-second timeslice to prevent data loss
mediaRecorderRef.current.start(1000);
```

## üìã User Workflow

### Simple 2-Button System

**To Start Everything:**
1. Click **"Start Camera & Recording"**
2. That's it! Camera and recording both start

**To Stop Everything:**

## üé¨ Recording Behavior

### Automatic Segments
- **00:00 - 05:00** ‚Üí First 5-minute video
- **05:00** ‚Üí Auto-saves, starts new recording
- **05:00 - 10:00** ‚Üí Second 5-minute video
- **10:00** ‚Üí Auto-saves, starts new recording
- And so on...

### File Naming
```
recording_20251019_140000.webm  (First segment)
recording_20251019_140500.webm  (5 minutes later)
recording_20251019_141000.webm  (10 minutes later)
recording_20251019_141500.webm  (15 minutes later)
```

### Example: 1 Hour Recording
- Total files: 12 videos
- Each file: ~15-20 MB
- Total size: ~180-240 MB
- Storage: `/backend/recordings/`
