- **Dot**: Small pulsing dot (w-2 h-2)

}
```

**Key Point**: `this.isRecording` flag controls auto-restart

## 📝 Code Changes Summary

### 1. Dashboard.jsx
```jsx
// Added back status tracking
const [recordingStatus, setRecordingStatus] = useState({
  isRecording: false,
  recordingTime: 0
});

// Added useEffect to track status
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    const status = backgroundRecordingService.getStatus();
    setRecordingStatus({...});
  }, 1000);
}, []);

// Compact indicator (only when recording)
{recordingStatus.isRecording && (
  <div className="bg-red-500 text-white px-4 py-2 ...">
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
      <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-white rounded-full animate-ping"></div>
      <Video className="w-4 h-4" />
      <span>Recording</span>
    </div>
    <span>{formatTime(recordingStatus.recordingTime)}</span>
  </div>
)}
```

### 2. Live Monitoring.jsx
```jsx
// Full control banner (always visible)
<div className={`${recordingStatus.isRecording ? 'bg-red-500' : 'bg-gray-600'} ...`}>
  {/* Status text */}
  {/* Timer */}
  {/* Start/Stop buttons */}
</div>
```

### 3. backgroundRecording.js
```javascript
// Modified onstop handler
this.mediaRecorder.onstop = async () => {
  // Save video
  await this.uploadVideo(blob);
  
  // Only auto-restart if still recording
  if (this.stream && this.isInitialized && this.isRecording) {
    setTimeout(() => this.startRecording(), 500);
  }
  // If isRecording=false, stay stopped
};
```
